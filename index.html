     <p>As the initial creator of upscale user friendly mechanisms, Steve Jobs’s accomplishments in technology continue to have profound effects today. The competition created from the introduction of the iPod, iPhone, and iPad has revolutionized the technology industry. Consumers have benefited from developments in phones and computing, and have a wider array of choices when purchasing computers, phones and tablets. While Jobs’s influence on technology was obvious, his philanthropy has gone widely unrecognized. Jobs donated to a variety of charitable causes, and he also sought to lessen the long lasting environmental impacts of Apple’s products by changing the company’s environmental policy.</p>
